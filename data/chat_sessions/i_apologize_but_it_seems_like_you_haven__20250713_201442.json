To do that, I'd love it if you could rephrase your query or ask a specific question. This will help me better understand what's on your mind and how I can assist you.\n\nWhat's been on your mind lately, and how can I help? Are you exploring the PAI3 foundation's language model or Radical AI Governance (RAGs) features in the context of healthcare? Are there any specific pain points or goals you'd like to discuss? \ud83e\udd14\n\nLet's work together to clarify your needs and achieve your goals! \ud83d\udcaa"
