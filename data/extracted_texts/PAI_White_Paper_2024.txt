Abstract  
The current landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) is dominated by a few major players who wield control 
over vast amounts of data and computational power, leading to significant challenges such as privacy 
risks, limited access, and monopolistic control . PAI3  seeks to transform this centralized paradigm by 
creating a decentralized AI platform that empowers individuals, enhances data privacy, and democratizes 
access to AI technologies.  
 
PAI3  utilizes a decentralized mesh network of user -owned devices, known as PAI3  Computers, to form a 
global supercomputer that performs large -scale AI tasks, including data processing, model training, and 
personalized inference. By leveraging blockchain technology, PAI3  ensures secure, transparent, and 
equitable management of resources, using Non -Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent ownership stakes 
in the network and provide guaranteed returns to early adopters and contributors. Quadratic Voting (QV) 
is employed as a gov ernance model, allowing all token holders to participate in decision -making while 
preventing centralization of control.  
 
The platform offers multiple earning opportunities for users, including running compute nodes, staking 
tokens, selling AI models and datasets, and participating in governance. This comprehensive approach 
incentivizes active engagement and fosters a vibrant  ecosystem where users can monetize their 
contributions and influence the platform’s future direction. Additionally, PAI3  prioritizes data privacy and 
security by using decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and end -to-end encryption 
to protect user data.

 1.0 - Introduction  
Decentralized AI (DAI) represents a paradigm shift in how AI is developed, trained, and controlled.  The 
rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed industries, economies, and societies 
worldwide. But this transformation is not merely a story of progress and innovation —it is a tale of 
domination and oppression. As AI systems become in creasingly sophisticated and omnipresent, we face 
a dire reality: AI’s future and governance are being determined by a cabal of corporate giants. The 
centralization of AI development and resources in the hands of a few powerful corporations has given rise 
to a monopolistic stronghold over our digital lives. Sensitive information is sequestered within the walls of 
centralized servers controlled by a select elite, creating a fortress of data silos that shields their power 
while stripping us of our privacy and  autonomy. While this centralization can pose a threat that challenges 
our freedom (Jones 2019) , it can stifle innovation, relegate advanced technologies to those with immense 
financial and technological resources, and perpetuate a cycle of inequality.  
 
Recent developments in the AI industry underscore the urgency of this battle and highlighted a future 
especially in America that favors companies over the people (Orlick 2024) . The current AI landscape is 
dominated by a few major players who control vast computational resources and financial power, leading 
to several critical issues . Centralized AI systems store user data on centralized servers, increasing the 
risk of privacy breaches and unauthorized access. High -profile data leaks and misuse scandals have 
highlighted the vulnerabilities of these systems, where users have little cont rol over how their data is 
used, stored, or shared (King and Meinhardt 2024) . Additionally, the reliance on proprietary, large 
datasets limits data sharing, introducing biases and reducing the effectiveness of AI applications across 
different domains. Moreover, centralized AI often fails to deliver personalized experiences tailore d to 
individual users' needs, as these systems are primarily designed to serve the broad requirements of large 
corporations. The high costs associated with developing and deploying advanced AI models also create 
significant barriers to entry for smaller pl ayers, stifling competition and innovation.  
 
The AI arms race is not a mere contest of technological prowess —it is a high -stakes struggle for control 
over our future. Figures like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are not merely advancing their interests  without 
guardrails ; they are architects of a new world order where the few dictate the terms for the many  through 
public manipulation and seeding doubt  in election  integrity (Jingnan 2024)  The relentless pursuit of the 
most powerful AI models, driven by these influential figures, is a race towards unchecked power and 
societal upheaval. As highlighted by  The Washington Post,  this race threatens to spiral out of control, 
leaving us vulnerable to unbridled AI advancements (Letters to the Editor 2024) . Moreover, corporate 
behemoths like Google, as reported by The New York Times , have leveraged their dominance to quash 
competition, undermining fair market practices and stifling innovation (McCabe 2024) . Nvidia, the 
gatekeeper of AI hardware, wields its power to limit public participation, creating a digital divide where 
only a select few have access to the future of AI (Mashable BrandX and NVIDIA 2023) . This gatekeeping 
of the compute  resources and access can lead to a vulnerability where the people’s access to the newest 
powerful tool  can be denied by singular controlling entities . As seen in 2010, Sony Computers disabled  
"Install Other OS" feature on  PlayStation 3s  and denied average people from building affordable super 
computers (Ganapati 2010) .  
 
As the compute power  for AI and deep learning increases  in accordance Moore’s law  (The Physics ArXiv 
2022) , the people’s barriers  to entry  to AI future  should decrease  resulting in th e democratization of AI.  
The current  centralized control is not just a threat; it is an existential crisis that demands a resolute stand.  
There is a clear need for an alternative approach to AI development and deployment —one that prioritizes 
its primary users and their data privacy, security, and empowerment.  We, at the PAI3  Foundation, hope to 
encourage people to contribute and promote diversity to AI’s future.  
  
1.1 PAI3  Foundation vision for the future of AI
3 
 In this context, the People’s Artificial Intelligence for a Web3 world or “ PAI3 ” represents an alternative 
against these monopolistic AI giants. PAI3  presents  a revolutionary solution to these problems by offering 
a decentralized AI platform that belongs to and serves the people. Unlike the current centralized models, 
PAI3  is designed to democratize access to AI, sharing AI modeling and computing power, making 
advanced technologies available to everyone, regardless of financial resources or technical expertise.  
 
 Our decentralized  computing  network, bolstered by PAI3  NFTs, represents a paradigm shift towards 
democratizing AI access and empowering individuals. Each PAI3  NFTs ensures guaranteed monthly 
revenue, preferential processing rates, and access to exclusive features, effectively dismantling the data 
silos controlled by the tech elite.  
 
As we confront the centralized tyranny of today’s AI landscape, PAI3  stands as a revolutionary force 
dedicated to reclaiming our digital future and ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared by all, not just a 
privileged few. PAI3  envisions a world where AI is not controlled by a select few but is accessible to 
everyone. Our goal is to create a decentralized AI platform that prioritizes user privacy, security, and 
control. By harnessing the power of decentralized technology, we aim  to provide a secure, efficient, and 
user-centric AI experience that empowers individuals to take ownership of their data and computing 
power. We foresee a grassroots movement of individuals who refuse to submit to the AI monopolies. This 
legion of “Free m inds” will fight back by a World Computer that is a decentralized mesh designed to 
shatter the chains of centralized A I. Each NFT in this collection represents a member of the PAI3  
community, a digital warrior fighting for the right to think freely, to innovate, and to live without the fear of 
AI tyranny. These NFTs are more than just art; they are keys to the World Computer, empowering the 
holder to join the resistance.  
 
To realize this vision, PAI3  aims to launch the largest supercomputer owned and operated by the people. 
This initiative will be powered by a mesh of user -owned computers, each contributing to the collective 
computational power needed to train and run AI models. To support this, PAI3  will issue a limited number 
of NFTs that represent ownership stakes in the mesh. These NFTs will be sold at a fixed price for early 
adopters, with subsequent auctions to follow. This model not only incentivizes participation but also 
ensures that the bene fits of AI are distributed more equitably across society.  
 
1.2 - Call to Action: Be a part of a decentralized future of AI  
In summary, PAI3  represents a groundbreaking shift in the AI landscape, offering a decentralized, secure, 
and user -centric platform that empowers individuals and democratizes access to advanced AI 
technologies. This white paper will explore the technical architecture, tok enomics, and key benefits of 
PAI3 , providing a comprehensive overview of how this platform can reshape the future of AI for the better.  
 
Become a co -owner of the future of AI by securing your place in the PAI3  decentralized network through 
the purchase of an NFT. This simple step not only grants you ownership within the PAI3 Network  but also 
empowers you with the ability to protect your privacy and ensure that AI agents serve your needs —not 
those of Big AI. By owning an NFT, you gain the opportunity to train and sell your own AI agents, fully 
tailored to your individual requirements.  These agents are yours to control and monetize within the PAI3  
marketplace. In essence, by owning a "brick in the wall," you are actively contributing to the construction 
of a robust, user -driven AI ecosystem that stands as a defense against centralized AI monopolies, 
ensuring that the power of AI remains in the hand s of the people.  
 
2.0 - Decentralizing AI  
In 2021, Sir Tim Berners -Lee, the inventor of the internet, proposed a paradigm shift to a digital world with 
people in control of their data instead of gatekeepers (Lohr 2021) . Now, this paradigm is being considered 
for AI.  DAI refers to the integration of AI and blockchain technology toward a democratization of AI,
4 
 ensuring individual users are guiding this technology's future. AI technology has multiple complex 
components, each playing a crucial role in shaping how these systems operate and impact our lives  
(GaiaNet 2024) . Among these, there are specific parts of AI that people need to own and control to 
ensure that AI serves the public inte rest and remains safe and secure. One of the most critical aspects is 
the ownership of AI agents —these should be built and controlled by individuals to ensure they operate 
with honesty and transparency. PAI3  empowers users to build their own AI agents, running them on 
neutral models like large language models (LLMs) or small language models (SLMs). However, the real 
risk lies in the inference processes, RAGS, and vector embeddings. These elements are where data is 
interpreted and decisions are made, making it essential that they are controlled by the users who rely on 
them. To  mitigate these risks, it's crucial for people to have ownership over the compute space and 
inference engines that power these AI systems. If users control the environment where computation 
occurs and how inferences are made, they can ensure that AI operat es safely, without being co -opted by 
centralized entities or manipulated for purposes that do not align with public interest. This approach aligns 
with the broader goals of DAI, where the distribution of AI components across a mesh —and under the 
control of  the people —enhances privacy, security, and user autonomy. By decentralizing AI and giving 
people ownership over critical components like AI agents, compute resources, and inference 
mechanisms, PAI3  aims to create a safer and more equitable AI ecosystem that truly serves the needs of 
individuals (Oodles Blockchain 2024) . 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Focus is shifting from infra to specialized models  
 
 
DAI offers a promising solution to these challenges and is suitable for organizations and individuals that 
own their data and do not want to share it, particularly for medical, banking, surveillance, and data mining 
sectors (Singh et al. 2024) . By leveraging blockchain and federated learning technologies, DAI can 
provide secure, efficient, and user -centric AI platforms. These platforms empower individuals by giving 
them control over their data and AI interactions, thereby ensuring privacy and fos tering trust. Blockchain 
technology plays a crucial role in this process. By providing an auditable trail of data access and 
modifications, the blockchain ensures that users can trust the system. Every interaction with the data is 
recorded on an immutable ledger, making it impossible to tamper with the information without detection.  
 
In the evolving landscape of AI, decentralization offers a promising approach to enhancing privacy, 
security, and user autonomy . DAI involves distributing various components across a network rather than 
relying on centralized entities. Several aspects of AI can be decentralized:  
● Decentralized Computation and Inference: One of the most challenging aspects of 
decentralization is the distribution of computational tasks. Each PAI3  device will act as part of a 
decentralized computational mesh, where processing power and access are managed through 
NFTs. Users could lease their computational resources, with time and resource restrictions 
managed via smart contracts and verifiable cred entials (VCs). A critical challenge will be ensuring
5 
 parallel processing with consensus while maintaining confidentiality. A potential solution is to 
compute data locally on the user’s device, sharing only the resulting vector embeddings and 
models rather than raw data.  
 
AI model inferences and user data can be decentralized by running both on the same hardware, 
allowing the model to be augmented with personalized user data. The augmented models could 
then be shared or monetized without revealing the underlying dataset, pr eserving privacy while 
enabling distributed AI capabilities.  
 
● Data Storage and Management:  Primary user data storage can be decentralized using PAI3  
hardware, which will serve as the foundational layer for data storage and processing. This data, 
coupled with NFTs for access control, will be integrated into a computational mesh for 
decentralized computing. To ensure user privacy, data will need to be e nd-to-end encrypted and 
tokenized, allowing personalized data to be concealed yet usable. Additionally, decentralized 
identifiers (DIDs) could be implemented to manage user identity securely. For secondary storage, 
platforms like InterPlanetary File System  (IPFS ) (e.g., IPFS Kubo ) could be used to store 
summaries of previous data, adding an extra layer of decentralization and redundancy. Control 
over the data used in the model is controlled by a mesh of individuals rather than the bigger 
monopolies.  
 
● Personalized Model Training and Deployment:  The best AI s start with the best data (Ibarra 2024) . 
Thus, utilizing a distributed framework will enable each user to contribute their data to a 
successful  future for AI. Decentralized training frameworks allow multiple parties to contribute to 
the training of an AI model without sharing their raw data. Techniques like Federated Learning 
enable the training of models across decentralized devices, aggregating updates while keeping 
data local. AI models can be deployed in a decentrali zed manner where different parts of the 
model or different models are hosted across multiple nodes. This can improve robustness and 
reduce the risk of a single point of failure.  
 
● Decentralized Vector storage  
Vector embeddings generated by LLMs or RAGs will be stored in a decentralized manner within 
PAI3 ’s Vector Package. Like user data storage, DIDs could be employed to securely manage and 
identify these vectors, ensuring that users retain control over their data while enabling 
decentralized AI operations.  
 
● Consensus -making and governance: Decentralized AI systems can use smart contracts and 
decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to govern AI models and their updates, ensuring 
that decisions about the AI's behavior are made collectively rather than by a single entity.  
 
● Monetization and Incentives: Decentralized AI systems can incorporate token -based incentives, 
where participants are rewarded for contributing data, computing power, or other resources to the 
AI system.  Furthermore, a marketplace can be developed where each contributor can get a fair 
reward for their contributions .  
 
These components, when decentralized, create a robust and secure AI ecosystem that leverages the 
power of distributed computing and data management while  addressing privacy and security concerns.

 One of the key benefits of PAI3  is its focus on data privacy and security. User data remains local, 
reducing the risk of breaches and increasing data ownership and control. Blockchain technology provides 
an auditable trail of data access and modifications, ensuring trust and security  (Nakamoto 2008) . Unlike 
centralized AI, PAI3  offers user -owned computers with inexpensive personal AI machines that interact 
with big models, execute small models locally, and protect user data and identity. There is no transfer of 
data to centralized servers or the cloud, and PAI3  Computers generate revenue from paid nodes. Users 
own their models, which can be confined to curated data sets, and their data, which can be sold for 
training purposes while maintaining 100% privacy.  
 
Data Privacy and Security - One of the most significant advantages of PAI3  is the emphasis on data 
privacy and security. In a world where data breaches are becoming increasingly common, PAI3  offers a 
solution where user data remains local, significantly reducing the risk of breaches. By keeping data on the 
user’s device, PAI3  ensures that individuals maintain full ownership and control over their information.  
 
3.2 - Key Differences from Centralized AI  
PAI3  distinguishes itself from centralized AI models in several critical ways:  
● User -Owned Compute in PAI3  Fabric:  PAI3  allows users to own and control their computing 
power. This ensures that users can run AI models on their devices without relying on expensive 
cloud -based solutions. PAI3  offers an affordable AI computing device that interacts with large 
models while executing small models locally. This design protects user data and identity by 
keeping information on the user’s device rather than transferring it to centralized servers.  
● User -Owned Models:  Users can create and train their models on PAI3 , tailored with specific data 
sets. These specialized augmented models can be developed for specific fields such as 
healthcare, finance, education, or coding. This gives users full control over their AI models and 
ensures that their data is used only for t heir benefit.  
● User -controlled Data - Users can own and control their data on their local PAI3  computer to 
preserve privacy and confidentiality. Furthermore, PAI3  computer owners can permission their 
data and embeddings for model training.  
● Revenue Generation: PAI3  provides an opportunity for users to generate income by running 
nodes on their devices. Users can sell their data for training, participate in the network, and earn 
PAI3  tokens, all while maintaining 100% privacy.  
 
3.3 - Key use -cases and Consumer applications  
As AI continues to integrate into various aspects of our lives, it is crucial to address the dangers 
associated with centralized AI systems that often prioritize corporate interests over individual rights. The 
PAI3  platform offers a decentralized alternative that empowers users by enabling the creation and 
ownership of personalized AI agents tailored to their specific needs. These agents, whether personal, 
professional, or enterprise -level, are designed to serve the  individual user, ensuring that AI systems are 
trustworthy, transparent, and aligned with the user’s goals. The core philosophy behind PAI3  is that AI 
agents must do no harm, and this is achieved by placing control over key AI components —such as 
inference engines and data processing —in the hands of the users themselves.  
 
PAI3  provides users with the tools to create  Personal AI Agents  that enhance daily life, from managing 
tasks and productivity to offering personalized advice and support. These agents operate on neutral 
models but are owned and controlled by the user, ensuring that they serve the individual’s interests. For

industries like healthcare, finance, or education. These agents can provide industry -specific insights, 
streamline workflows, and even be monetized through the PAI3  marketplace. At the enterprise level, 
Enterprise AI Agents  built on PAI3 ’s decentralized mesh can handle large -scale AI tasks, from data 
aggregation to complex model training, all while maintaining the privacy and security of proprietary data.
7 
 Finally, Community AI Agents  allow for broader collaboration and data sharing within the PAI3  
ecosystem, enabling communities to collectively build, manage, and benefit from AI technologies.  
 
Through PAI3 , users can own a piece of the AI infrastructure itself, contributing to and benefiting from a 
decentralized supercomputer network. This ownership model not only democratizes access to advanced 
AI technologies but also ensures that AI development is guided  by the collective interests of its users 
rather than a centralized authority. Whether creating personal digital assistants, professional tools, or 
enterprise solutions, PAI3  empowers users to harness the full potential of AI in a way that is safe, secure, 
and beneficial to society.

4.0- PAI3  ecosystem utilizing mesh computing  
The PAI3  ecosystem is designed to distribute computing power in a mesh configuration to decentralized 
AI while isolating highly sensitive data on secure hardware computers. PAI3 Network  is a collection of 
PAI3  Nodes that include personal user devices and computers that host a personalized instance of the 
large language model for each user’s queries that can utilize their secured data on their node.  
Collectively, this mesh will become the foundation for the People’s supercomputer.  Each Node represents 
an opportunity to contribute computing resources with access granted via an NFT purchase or lease .  
 
Each PAI3  contributor  will engage the PAI3 Network  using a digital wallet via their personal devices  
including  mobile phone s or personal computers , and each user interaction, task, and query will be 
coordinated by a personal AI agent that can navigate the mesh for the appropriate resources  to each 
query. AI modelers  and Data curators with powerful computers  can further train the PAI3  AI model to 
handle specialized needs, tasks, and subjects . Each Node is verifiable by a  DID on an identity blockchain  
enabling secure peer -to-peer communication within the Mesh . (Figure 2). Furthermore, an index of vector 
embeddings is also stored on the blockchain. The development of a blockchain -based decentralized 
computational mesh (Muthe, Sharma, and Sri 2020; Asharaf and Adarch 2017)  will allow resources to be 
shared among PAI3  devices, optimizing processing and data management (Oodles Blockchain 2024; 
LAMPORT and LYNCH 1990)  . Users of the PAI3 Network  can include Contributors that consent access 
to available de -identified datasets and vectors to 2) Data Curators that are building customized and 
specialized vector packages for the PAI3  AI engine to use. 
 
4.1 - PAI3 Network  environment for compute and data request  
The PAI3 Network  is a decentralized network where multiple PAI3  devices collaborate to provide 
distributed computing power and data storage. Each PAI3  computer or node contributes processing 
resources and storage capacity, creating a resilient and scalable system. Data is securely stored across 
the mesh on each user’s computer or other technologies like IPFS, with encryption ensuring privacy. 
Artificial  agents plan, coordinate, and execute sequences of actions on each user’s behalf within each 
user’s node and between the nodes in the mesh. Consensus mechanisms and smart contracts manage 
resource leasing and access permissions, ensuring secure and efficie nt operations  (Asharaf and Adarch 
2017) .

The PAI3  Node is the environment within the Mesh where AI models are executed,  and training data is 
submitted . Nodes  include PAI3  AI agent, RAGS  operations , AI and models to coordinate and respond to  
the requests. Each node is designed to be controlled from PAI3  Computers or other hardware, such as 
PAI3  computers, personal computers , and mobile devices  that contain PAI3  identity wallet and data 
storage . The PAI3  user's mobile device or PC interface with external systems such as approved IOT 
devices and the PAI3  Node that is controlled by PAI3  Agent. The Agent orchestrates the connections and 
data flow within the PAI3  Node, ensuring secure and efficient interaction within the ecosystem (Gabriel et 
al. 2024) . Each PAI3  Node can query a blockchain for decentralized identity’s each PAI3  computer, user, 
agent, and node to verify assets access using zero -knowledge proofs (ZK).

Figure 3: PAI3 Node  
 
User data lies on a spectrum between personal data with high sensitivity to curated data available for 
contribution to the PAI3 Network . Thus, an anonymizing process will be developed to transform raw 
personal data into curated data and to minimize inadvertent disclosures to the network. Given the 
sensitivity, the PAI3  Node will have a public and private IPFS vault for user files to balance the need for 
privacy and confidentiality, while encouraging data contributi ons. Users can create custom datasets or 
redact personal or sensitive data elements for curation in their public container. Only curated data 
including data files, inferences, and vector embedding can be sold to data “Curators” to form bigger 
datasets or AI “ Tuners” to augment or train specialized AI models.  
 
PAI3  users can submit computer requests for queries and prompts  such as “Find me the best flight to 
New York”  to an AI model to develop an inference  indicated in the black arrows in Figure 3.  The p rompt is 
augmented with further context security and utility guardrails by the  RAGS on the Node. The PAI3  Agent 
identifies the best available node to compute the inference, the best AI model and vector embeddings via 
the vector index on the blockchain. Each computing node’s AI model produces an inference,  and the 
resulting vector embedding  is returned to the requesting node. (Figure 3 A) Every operation will be 
conducted on multiple nodes in parallel to achieve consensus and accuracy. Resulting AI inferences and 
vector embeddings from each compute request are returned to the original requesters Public IPFS vault 
indicated in the green arrows in Figure 3. Additionally, the Agent will manage the decentralized data 
storage of user files, summaries, and vector packages on the PAI3  hardware and the IPFS.  
 
Furthermore, operations such as AI model tuning may require supplemental computing resources beyond 
what is available on the local computer . With the PAI3 Network , AI tuners can request additional nodes 
for greater compute  power  indicated in black arrows  (Figure 3 B) . The vector embeddings are returned to 
their IPFS vault indicated with green arrow in Figure 3.   By combining multiple nodes and utilizing parallel 
computing, PAI3  will offer a cheaper and more trusted environment for AI tuning. This distributed compute 
offers  an opportunity for PAI3  contributors to earn revenue while their computer is being used  in the 
Mesh.

Figure 4: PAI3 data workflows for AI queries and conditioning  
To allocate compute workload to multiple nodes based on the given parameters (available node capacity, 
node reputation, lowest latency, proximity, and location), a weighted scoring approach will be used where 
each node is assigned a score based on the following factors. The workload is then distributed in 
propo rtion to these scores.  
 
To calculate the workload allocation, first we will compute the weighted score ( Score i) for each node 
using the following equation  
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒  𝑖 = 𝑤𝑐 × 𝐶i + 𝑤𝑟 × 𝑅𝑖 + 𝑤𝑖 ×𝐿i + 𝑤𝑝 ×P𝑖 
 
where: wc, wr, wi, and wp  are the weights assigned to each parameter based on their 
importance. These weights should sum up to 1.  
 
The parameters are denoted as the following for each node i: 
- Ci = Available node capacity (as a percentage or normalized value)  
- Ri = Node reputation (normalized between 0 and 1)  
- Li = Latency (normalized inverse, i.e., lower latency gets higher score)  
- Pi = Proximity score (optional, normalized between 0 and 1)
13 
 - wi = Final workload allocated to node i 
 
Total work allocation is determined by:  
𝑆 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = ∑ 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒  𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1   
 
Each parameter should be normalized with the following equation.  
S′i = (𝑆i – 𝑆min )/(𝑆max −𝑆min )  
 
where Si= actual value of parameter for node.  
 
Finally, the workload allocated to node is given by:  
Wi = Score 𝑖
𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙   × 𝑊total ,  
 
 where Wtotal is the total workload to be distributed among the nodes.

specialized and contextual solutions across various industries.  
 
AI integrates various technologies to simulate human intelligence in machines. At its core are LLMs, 
which are advanced AI systems trained on extensive datasets to generate and understand human -like 
text. PAI3  will use an open -source LLM to be a base LLM. RAGs enhance LLMs by combining them with 
retrieval methods, accessing external data for more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. Vector 
embeddings are numerical representations of language elements, crucial for  tasks like semantic search 
and natural language understanding, as they capture relationships and meanings in a multi -dimensional 
space. Inferences  refer to the application of learned knowledge by AI models to make predictions or
14 
 decisions, enabling real -time tasks such as fraud detection and personalized recommendations. These 
foundational concepts are essential in the development and application of AI technologies.  
 
LLMs on the PAI3  platform will serve as the foundation for generating human -like text and understanding 
complex queries across a wide array of domains. These models can process and generate text at scale, 
making them suitable for diverse applications, from customer service automation to advanced research in 
various fields.  The PAI3  foundation will tune the base LLM toward a PAI3  language model with PAI3  
inferences.  
 
To enhance the contextual relevance of these models, the platform will integrate RAGs. RAGs combine 
the generative power of LLMs with the precision of retrieval systems, enabling the models to access and 
incorporate specific, up -to-date information from ex ternal sources like databases or the web. This 
capability will be particularly beneficial for industries that require real -time, accurate information, such as 
finance or legal services. Vector embeddings will further augment the PAI3  models by enabling efficient 
and effective handling of high -dimensional data. These embeddings will allow the models to represent 
words, phrases, and concepts as numerical vectors in a multi -dimensional space, facilitating more 
accurate and context -aware responses. The use of vector embeddings will also improve the model’s 
ability to search and retrieve relevant information, enhancing the overall performance of the RAG system. 
Vector embeddings will be stored on PAI3  hardware or on each user’s  IPFS.  
 
Each user will have multiple vector packages that can include vectorizations of their private and sensitive 
data within each PAI3  node that can be used  for each user’s AI queries. In addition, curated vector 
packages can be created via a de -identification mechanism or a curation of a unique data set for subject 
specific content for specialized searches with specific content. These curated datasets can be  made 
available for sale to the PAI3 Network  on the PAI3  Marketplace.  
 
Inferences on the PAI3  platform will enable real -time application of AI models for decision -making and 
predictions. These inference capabilities will be crucial for scenarios requiring immediate responses, such 
as real -time fraud detection in financial services, predictive main tenance in manufacturing, or diagnostic 
support in healthcare. By enabling models to perform inferences on the edge or in the cloud, PAI3  will 
offer scalable and efficient AI -powered solutions across multiple sectors.  
 
4.4 - PAI3  AI assistant/agent  
In the PAI3  ecosystem, an AI Agent is  a sophisticated artificial intelligence entity designed to 
autonomously plan and execute sequences of actions on behalf of the user across the decentralized PAI3 
Network  (Gabriel et al. 2024) . These agents act independently, receiving high -level instructions from 
users and translating them into detailed, actionable tasks that align with the user's goals and 
expectations. The PAI3  Agent will have guardrails to do no harm to the user and be loyal to its controller 
while not benefiting unauthorized PAI3  users.  
 
A crucial role of the PAI3  AI Agent is its ability to coordinate a personalized AI experience by integrating 
and managing user data within the distributed AI network. By leveraging the decentralized nature of the 
PAI3  platform, the AI Agent ensures that the user’s data remains secure and private while still providing 
the necessary inputs to tailor AI responses and actions to the user’s specific needs. This personalized 
experience is further enhanced by the AI Agent’s s eamless coordination with the user's connected IoT 
devices, files stored on the IPFS, and cloud -based services for prompt augmentation.  
 
Within the PAI3  framework, the AI Agent interacts with IoT devices to gather real -time data, integrates this 
information into task execution processes, and accesses files on IPFS to retrieve critical data securely.
15 
 For complex prompts, the AI Agent leverages cloud -based AI services, accessing advanced models to 
augment the prompt and deliver highly accurate, contextually relevant results.  
 
This integrated approach allows the PAI3  AI Agent to function as a powerful and adaptive tool that not 
only operates within the PAI3 Network  but also extends its capabilities to the user’s broader digital 
ecosystem. By coordinating these various elements, the AI Agent ensures that each user enjoys a truly

components and mechanisms will be employed. Blockchains will enable robust consensus management, 
efficient parallel process management, and enforceable smart contracts. These features are critical for 
ensuring trans parency, security, and coordination across the Mesh. Additionally, self -sovereign identity 
systems utilizing DIDs , and VCs will provide secure and autonomous identity management  (Tobin and 
Reed 2017) . Finally, non -fungible tokens (NFTs) will be used to establish membership, manage 
resources, and facilitate transactions within the PAI3 Network , linking users to specific computational 
resources and data assets.  
 
● Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)  and PAI3  tokens  
NFTs will play a crucial role in establishing membership and managing resources within the PAI3 
Network . Each NFT will serve as proof of membership, linking users to specific PAI3  computers 
and their associated files. These NFTs can be used to grant access to the mesh, allocate 
computational resources, and facilitate transactions within the decentralized AI ecosystem. By 
pointing to a specific PAI3  computer, NFTs help manage ownership and access rights, ensuring 
that resources are allocated efficiently and transparently across the PAI3 Network . The PAI3  
tokens will utilize  the Ethereum  blockchain (Buterin 2014) .  
 
● Consensus Management, Parallel Process Management, and Smart Contracts  
Blockchain technology can be integral to managing decentralized AI within the PAI3  platform. By 
using blockchains like Ethereum  (Buterin 2014) , consensus mechanisms can be employed to
16 
 validate and synchronize the parallel processing tasks across the PAI3 Network . Smart contracts 
can automate and enforce the rules governing computational tasks, resource allocation, and 
reward distribution. These contracts ensure that each task is executed as agreed, with outcomes 
verified through the blockchain, promoting transparency and trust within the decentralized 
system.  
 
● Self-Sovereign Identity and DIDs with VCs  
To manage identity verification, access control, and permission leasing within the PAI3  
ecosystem, blockchains can be used to create a self -sovereign identity framework.  Platforms like 
Hyperledger Indy  (Hyperledger Foundation)  provide the necessary infrastructure to implement 
DIDs, which enable users to control their digital identities independently. VCs issued through the 
blockchain can be used to verify user identities, manage access to specific resources, and 
authorize or rev oke leasing privileges of computational power or data  (Tobin and Reed 2017) . 
This system ensures that only verified entities can participate in the PAI3 Network , enhancing 
security and privacy.  
 
Through  these mechanisms, blockchains  will provide the foundational infrastructure for a secure,

New PAI3  tokens will be emitted over a 50 -year schedule with decreasing emissions each year  until all 
tokens  have been added into circulation . The emission protocol is designed so that  new tokens will be  
released monthly.   Each year, emissions rate will decrease steadily  at an approximate  rate of 1.25%  until 
issuance is halted at 314,159 ,264 PAI3  tokens.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.4 - PAI3  governance  with quadratic voting  
The PAI3  DUNA  and its protocols  are governed by a decentralized model, empowering PAI3  token 
holders to participate directly in decision -making processes. This governance structure is built on the
22 
 principles of transparency, fairness, and inclusivity, using a  governance protocol based on Quadratic  Voting 
system (QV)  (Dimitri 2022; Buterin, Hitzig, and Weyl 2019)  to ensure all voices are heard proportionately. 
The ke y areas that require govern ance may  include  Platform Development, Token omics Adjustments, 
and Community and ecosystem growth.  
 
To create a balanced and democratic governance structure, the PAI3  Foundation  will use a QV -based  
system , where each voter is allocated  voting credits  that are valued quadratically depending  on their PAI3  
tokens holdings . Credits will only be issued for PAI3  token held more than 30 days.  Any token holder can 
submit proposals for a vote . Proposals are reviewed and discussed by the community before voting 
begins. Proposals that reach a majority under the quadratic voting rules are automatically executed via 
smart contracts, ensuring transparency and immutability.  This method prevents large stakeholders from 
disproportionately dominating decisions and encourages more nuanced expressions of preferences by all 
members.  Voting AI agents will be trained to identify improper voting and maintain fairness.   
 
Transparency and Security : 
All voting records and decisions are recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable and auditable 
ledger of governance actions. Smart contracts automate decision execution, ensuring that all processes 
remain transparent, secure, and tamper -proof.  
 
By implementing a governance model rooted in Quadratic Voting, PAI3  ensures equitable decision -
making and positions itself as a truly decentralized AI platform, where all stakeholders have a meaningful 
role in shaping the PAI3 Network  and AI’s future.

7.2 - Earning model for PAI3  compute   
PAI3  offers a flexible earnings model for users who contribute their computing power to the decentralized 
AI network. Users running PAI3  Computers can earn PAI3  tokens based on the number of compute hours 
their devices provide to the network each week. This model rewards users proportionally to the amount of 
computing resources they contribute, ensuring a fair and transparent distribution of earnings.  
 
Calculating user compute power and duration   
This project’s success relies heavily on widespread user adoption and active participation. To achieve 
critical mass, we want to encourage PAI3  users to add high performance computers to the Mesh, while 
demand is low. Thus, PAI3  users will earn compute revenue based on the user's CPU performance in 
GHz or FLOPS, GPU performance, Ram capacity, Storage capacity, and Network speed and Duration 
(Hrs). The computer units are calculated by the following formula:  
 
𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡  (𝐶𝑈)
= 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 × 𝐶𝑃𝑈  (𝐺𝐻𝑧 )+ 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎  × 𝐺𝑃𝑈  (𝐹𝐿𝑂𝑃𝑆 )+ 𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎  ×𝑅𝐴𝑀  (𝐺𝐵)+ 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎  
∗𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒  (𝑇𝐵)+ 𝑒𝑝𝑠𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑛  × 𝑁𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘  𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑  (𝐺𝑏𝑝𝑠 ) 
Where: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon are the weights assigned to each component based 
on their relative importance.  
 
For PAI3 , we will prioritize GPU performance, RAM capacity, CPU performance, Network bandwidth, and 
Storage capacity . Network bandwidth is determined by pinging node every 5 minutes to access network 
performance. This ping algorithm will also indicate system availability for computing. The Compute unit 
will be adjusted based on duration of computer availability to promote  high performing computers for 
longer durations of time.
24 
 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒  ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟 (𝐶𝐻)= 𝐶𝑈 × 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠  (𝐻𝑟𝑠 )  
 
PAI3  tokens will be earned based on the user’s  Compute -Hour to ensure that better quality computers 
and high quantities are being added to the Network during the initial phase of the project. During this PAI3 
Network  formation phase, NFT holders will earn reputation points based on their contributions that can be 
used to unlock benefits and discounts. Once the PAI3 Network  achieves 85% utilization, the top 15% of 
users will receive a higher rate of return on their computer revenue . This protocol incentives PAI3  
members to participate with high -performing computers, while not limiting computer opportunities for 
users with average computers.  
 
 
Weekly Earnings Model for PAI3  Compute Based on Compute Hours  
PAI3  offers a flexible earnings model for users who contribute their computing power to the decentralized 
AI network. PAI3  contributers  can earn PAI3  tokens based on the number of compute hours their devices 
provide to the network each week. This model rewards users proportionally to the amount of computing 
resources they contribute, ensuring a fair and transparent distribution of earnings. The weekly earnings 
for a PAI3  compute contributor are calculated using the following formula:  
 
𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑘𝑙𝑦  𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠  (𝑊𝐸)= 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒  ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟 (𝐶𝐻) × 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒  𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒  (𝐶𝑅) × 𝑁𝐹𝑇  𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛  
Where:  
• Compute Hours (CH ): The total number of hours the user's PAI3  Computer contributes to the 
network each week.  
• Compute Rate (CR): The base rate of earnings per compute hour, denominated in PAI3  
tokens. This rate is determined by the network and may fluctuate based on supply and 
demand for computing resources.  
• NFT Return : NFT holders can receive increased return on their compute. Osmos NFT  
holders with PAI3  computers  will receive  the highest return on computer at 1.3X, with Ethos 
and Mitos also returning a guaranteed compute return. Dynamis and Seismos received the 
standard rate.

9.0 - Discussion  
The emergence of PAI3  as a decentralized AI platform can mark a significant departure from the 
traditional, centralized models that currently dominate the AI industry. This shift toward decentralization 
addresses many of the critical challenges associated with centralized AI, including data privacy, security, 
accessibility, and equitable distribution of resources.  
 
Democratizing AI Access  
The PAI3  platform represents a significant evolution in the artificial intelligence landscape by shifting the 
paradigm from centralized to decentralized AI. This approach addresses many of the critical issues 
associated with traditional AI models, such as data pri vacy, security, accessibility, and the equitable 
distribution of AI resources. In an environment where a few corporations have historically controlled AI
28 
 development, PAI3  offers a model that democratizes AI, making it more inclusive and accessible to a 
broader range of users.  
 
One of the standout features of PAI3  is its potential to democratize AI access. By allowing individuals and 
smaller organizations to contribute their computing power to the mesh, PAI3  lowers the barriers to entry 
for AI participation. This not only makes AI tools and resources available to a wider audience but also 
fosters a more diverse and innovative AI ecosystem. As users contribute data and computational 
resources, they benefit fro m the collective capabilities of the PAI3 Network , which leads to more 
personalized and effective AI solutions.  
 
Addressing Data Privacy and Security  
PAI3 ’s decentralized approach also significantly enhances data privacy and security. In centralized AI 
systems, data is typically stored on servers controlled by large corporations, which increases the risk of 
breaches and unauthorized access. PAI3  mitigates these risks by decentralizing data storage and 
processing, allowing users to retain control over their data. This model aligns with growing global 
demands for greater transparency and user autonomy over personal information.  
 
Enhancing Personalization and Reducing Bias  
Centralized AI systems often rely on homogeneous data sets, which can lead to biased outcomes and 
limit the effectiveness of AI across diverse populations. PAI3 ’s decentralized model encourages the use 
of a wider variety of data sources, enhancing the ability of AI systems to provide personalized and 
unbiased outcomes. By enabling users to contribute their own data and computing power, PAI3  creates 
an ecosystem where AI solutions are better tailored to individual needs and preferences.  
 
Furthermore, the decentralized model of PAI3  promotes a more personalized AI experience while 
reducing the potential for bias. Centralized AI systems often rely on homogeneous data sets, which can 
lead to biased outcomes that do not serve diverse populations effectively. By enabling users to contrib ute 
their own data and tailor AI models to their specific needs, PAI3  ensures that AI outputs are more relevant 
and less prone to bias, thereby improving the overall quality and fairness of AI solutions.  
 
Economic and Social Implications  
The economic implications of PAI3  are equally transformative. By issuing NFTs as ownership stakes in 
the mesh, PAI3  introduces a new economic model that incentivizes participation and ensures that the 
benefits of AI are more evenly distributed. This model not only rewards users for their contributions but 
also aligns their interests with the long -term success of the pl atform, creating a sustainable and engaged 
community.  
 
10.0 - Conclusion  
PAI3  offers a revolutionary approach to AI development and deployment, tackling the most pressing 
challenges associated with centralized AI systems. By decentralizing data storage and processing, PAI3  
enhances data privacy and security, making AI more accessible and equitable. The platform’s ability to 
leverage a diverse array of data sources promises to reduce biases and improve the personalization of AI 
solutions.  
 
As the AI landscape continues to evolve, the need for decentralized solutions like PAI3  becomes 
increasingly apparent. Centralized models, with their inherent risks and limitations, are ill -suited to meet 
the demands of a future where AI is ubiquitous and integral to daily life. PAI3  provides a forward -looking 
path, where AI is not only more secure and efficient but also more inclusive and fairer .
29 
 The success of PAI3  will depend on widespread adoption and the active participation of a global 
community. By launching the largest supercomputer owned and operated by the people, PAI3  has the
