Email 1
Subject Line:
Why Your Alarm is Basically Useless (And What Can Fix It)
Body Copy:
Hi [First Name],
Have you ever come back to find your tools gone or a smashed window, wondering if your alarm even did anything? The harsh truth is, most alarms just make noise after thieves have already broken in and by then, it’s too late.
We get it. It can be very devastating to watch footage of someone walking away with what you worked so hard for.
At Stop Intruders, we believe security should do more than alert you after the fact. It should stop theft before it happens.
That’s why we created the Inferno system; a different kind of alarm that hits intruders with a blasting 120+ decibel sound the second they try to get in. This isn’t just loud noise. It’s unbearable, sharp, and forces anyone inside to run immediately.
No more waiting for police. No more damage already done. Just fast, effective deterrence.
What’s even better? Inferno is simple to install . Whether it’s a shipping container, van, retail shop, or outdoor storage, there’s a model that fits your space and needs.
If you’re tired of alarms that wait too long and thieves who get away, it’s time to see what real protection looks like.

Subject Line: Ever Worry About What You’ll Find When You Open That Door?
Email Body:
Hi [First Name],
That moment before you open your container, do you ever feel it?
That tiny bit of dread in your stomach, wondering if everything’s still there. If someone’s had a go in the night. If you’re about to discover a busted lock and a pile of empty cases where your tools used to be.
If that sounds familiar, you’re not being paranoid. You’re being real.
Containers get hit all the time. Quick break-ins. No witnesses. Thousands gone in minutes. And the worst part? You never see it coming.
But with Inferno Sentinel, you tell a different story.
With shock and vibration sensors that detect any forced impact, a magnetic door sensor that’s ready to trigger the moment the lock’s disturbed, a PIR sensor that catches movement the second someone steps inside, and instant alerts sent straight to your phone , you don’t find out after the break-in.
You stop it before it even happens.
And the best part?
 It works every time.
 Rain, wind, day or night. Your gear stays where you left it  because intruders don’t stand a chance.
This isn’t just a security system.
 It's a peace of mind you can install in under an hour.

Burglary Rates Are Rising — Here’s How to Stay One Step Ahead
The headlines are worrying. Your home security doesn’t have to be.
Hello [First Name],
You may have seen it in the news: Thefts from homes have surged to the highest levels in England and Wales since 2020:
🔗 Read the BBC article here https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2d113nlxo
For many of us, home is where we expect to feel safest. But with national news reporting a clear rise in break-ins and theft, it’s understandable to feel uneasy.
At StopIntruders, we believe in facing these realities with calm, practical action — not fear. We’ve worked with homeowners across the UK for years, helping them turn concern into confidence with simple, effective security solutions that actually stop intruders before they get inside.
What the Headlines Aren’t Telling You:
While the numbers are concerning, most burglaries are opportunistic. Criminals look for easy targets  unsecured homes, weak entry points, and outdated alarm setups.
The good news? That means most break-ins can be prevented.
How We Help You Stay a Step Ahead:
At StopIntruders, we specialise in enhancing your existing security setup, making your home a place criminals avoid altogether.
✔️ Inferno Indoor Deterrent — Designed to stop intruders in their tracks with a high-powered sound deterrent
 ✔️ Works with Your Alarm System — No need to replace what you already have; we strengthen it
 ✔️ Easy Installation — No complicated wiring, no expensive technicians
 ✔️ Trusted by Security Professionals — Real-world protection that works
Our mission is simple: help homeowners like you protect what matters most — with practical tools, not scare tactics.
The Time to Act is Before They Try
The BBC’s report is a reminder that security shouldn’t be left to chance. Taking simple steps now can make all the difference later.
If you’re already using an alarm system, ask yourself:
 ✔️ Does it stop intruders before they enter?
 ✔️ Does it actively disrupt break-ins, or simply alert you afterwards?
 ✔️ Are your deterrents visible, loud, and effective enough to make criminals think twice?
If the answer isn’t a confident “yes,” it’s time to explore what the Inferno Indoor can do for your home.
